  This table was created with:

  ```SQL
  create or replace table bigfunctions.eu.ip_network2country_code as

  with

  data as (
    select *
    from `bigfunctions.eu.dbip_country_lite`
  ),

  network2country_code as (
    select network, country_code
    from data,
    unnest(json_value_array(bigfunctions.eu.ip_range2ip_networks(first_ip, last_ip))) network
  ),

  network_bin_and_mask2country_code as (
    select
      net.ip_from_string(regexp_extract(network, r'(.*)/' )) as network_bin,
      cast(regexp_extract(network, r'/(.*)' ) as int64) as mask,
      country_code,
  from network2country_code
  )

  select *
  from network_bin_and_mask2country_code
  ```

  Then the file was created with:

  ```
  bq extract --destination_format PARQUET eu.ip_network2country_code gs://bigfunctions_data_europe_west1/ip_network2country_code.parquet
  ```

  Then copied locally with:

  ```
  gcloud storage cp gs://bigfunctions_data_europe_west1/ip_network2country_code.parquet data/
  ```
